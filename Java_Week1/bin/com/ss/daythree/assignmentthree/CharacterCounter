SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Because of a scheduling conflict with another prominent pro day, San Francisco 49ers general manager John Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan were unable to attend Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields' first pro day on March 30. Now, as Shanahan and Lynch hoped and expected, they will get another chance.

Ohio State is slated to have a second pro day on April 14, providing another opportunity for teams, including the Niners, to see Fields in person, a source told ESPN. The Athletic first reported that Fields, who is in the conversation for the 49ers with the No. 3 overall pick, will be participating in the second pro day.
